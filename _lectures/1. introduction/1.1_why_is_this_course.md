title: Why study this course?
tldr: "In the not too distant past, all electronics well analog. Over the past couple decades, however, analog circuitry has given way to the more verstile and easy to design digital electronic. The rise of digital electronics has many pundits predicting a sudden death of analog electronics. Furtunately, as this lecture will show, analog electronics is here to stay."
