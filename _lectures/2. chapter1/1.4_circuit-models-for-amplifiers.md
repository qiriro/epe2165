title: Circuit models for amplifiers
tldr: "Amplifier circuit vary in complexity, some with dozens of discrete components. In order to be able to apply the resulting amplifier circuit as a building block in a system, one must be able to characterize, or model, its terminal
behavior. This lecturer teaches amplifier models that can be applied irrespective of the complexity of the internal circuit of the amplifier. The values of the model parameters can be found either by analyzing the amplifier circuit or by performing measurements at the amplifier terminals."
