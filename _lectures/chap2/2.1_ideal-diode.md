title: Ideal diode
tldr: "The simplest and most fundamental nonlinear circuit element is the diode. Just like a
resistor, the diode has two terminals; but unlike the resistor, which has a linear (straight-line)
relationship between the current flowing through it and the voltage appearing across it, the
diode has a nonlinear iâ€“v characteristic. This lecture is concerned with the study of diodes. In order to understand the essence of the diode function, we begin with a fictitious element, the ideal diode"
