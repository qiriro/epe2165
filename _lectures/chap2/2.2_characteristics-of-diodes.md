title: Terminal Characteristics of Junction Diodes
tldr: "The most common implementation of the diode utilizes a pn junction. A pn junction can conduct
substantial current in the forward direction and almost no current in the reverse direction. In
this section we will study the iâ€“v characteristic of the pn junction diode in detail in order to prepare
ourselves for diode circuit applications."
