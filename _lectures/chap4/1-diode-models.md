title: Diode models
tldr: "The iterative diode circuit method we have seen so far is precise but time-consuming. Nevertheless, there are situations in which the effort and time required are still greater than can be justified. This lecture shows quick analysis methods that designers can use in order to evaluate various possibilities before deciding on a suitable diode circuit design."
