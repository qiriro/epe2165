title: The small-signal model of a diode
tldr: "A small-signal model is an AC equivalent circuit in which the nonlinear circuit elements are replaced by linear elements whose values are given by the first-order linear approximation of their characteristic curve near the bias point. The small-signal model uses a Maclaurin series expansion around a specific operating point. Using a small-signal model helps you understand more about your circuits, but it fails when the input signal gets too large"
