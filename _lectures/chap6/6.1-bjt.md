title: BJT structure and operations 
tldr: "This lecture introduces the Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), their physical structure and how they work. It also discusses how the voltage between two terminals of the transistor controls the current that
flows through the third terminal, and the equations that describe these currentâ€“voltage characteristics."
