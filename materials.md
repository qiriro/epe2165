          <h5>Horowitz, P., & Hill, W. (2015). The art of electronics (3rd edition)</h5>
          The Art of Electronics, by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, is a popular reference textbook dealing with analog and digital electronics. The book covers many areas of circuit design, from basic DC voltage, current, and resistance, to active filters and oscillators, to digital electronics, including microprocessors and digital bus interfacing. The book also includes many example circuits. In addition to having examples of good circuits, it also has examples of bad ideas, with discussions of what makes the good designs good and the bad ones bad. It can be described as a cross between a textbook and reference manual, though without the chapter-end questions and exercises which are often found in textbooks.

          <h5>Hayes, T. (2016). Learning the Art of Electronics</h5>
          Learning the Art of Electronics A Hands-On Lab Course is an
           introductory textbook complementary to the Art of Electronics. It offers not just explanations, but a full course. It teaches electronic circuits' operation in a way that is deeper and much more satisfying than the manipulation of formulas. It describes circuits that more traditional engineering introductions would postpone: on the third day, we build a radio receiver; on the fifth day, we build an operational amplifier from an array of transistors. The digital half of the course centers on applying microcontrollers, but gives exposure to Verilog, a powerful Hardware Description Language.
